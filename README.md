# 🕹️ RogueGen-CLI
### *Procedural Dungeon Map Generator for Roguelike Games*

## 📖 Overview
A Python-based tool that demonstrates **procedural content generation (PCG)**. Using a modified "Random Walk" algorithm, this script carves out unique, organic-looking dungeon layouts within the terminal. This is a foundational concept used in games like *Slay the Spire* or *Enter the Gungeon*.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Randomized Layouts:** No two maps are ever the same.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Runs on pure Python with no external libraries needed.
* **Game Dev Logic:** Showcases grid-based coordinate systems and algorithmic carving.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Concepts:** Procedural Generation, 2D Arrays, Randomization.

## 🚀 Usage
Simply run the script to generate a new map:
```bash
python generator.py
